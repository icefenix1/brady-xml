### App Issues

There is something wierd happening with the config where the app.config file is being coppied and renamed instead of just copied. I have made ajustments to use both names.

The classes and objects could do with some refactoring. While it works and is under standable there is room for some consolidation and simplification.

While it wasn't listed in the spec some form of logging should be added.

### Unit Test Issues

There should be more test scenarios.

The test data should be loaded from a file.

There should probably be more tests as well.
